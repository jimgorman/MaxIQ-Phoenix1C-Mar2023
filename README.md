# MaxIQ-Phoenix1C-Mar2023
Payload code for Phoenix 1C rocket test launch. Collaboration between University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, MaxIQ, and ASRI

Two versions of the code were made.  The SparkFun version has been tested because we have that sensor.  However, the actual sensor to be used is the KXTJ3 accelerometer version.  That code has not been tested by us.
